ðŸš§ **NOTE: THIS  PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ðŸš§

This web scraper is designed to efficiently extract data from retail websites such as Walmart, No Frills, etc., to help automate the process of logging in products to the database. Built using Python, it leverages libraries such as BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and Requests or Selenium for fetching web pages. The scraper navigates through web pages, extracts relevant data, and structures it for further analysis or storage. The **"TestVersions"** folder contains experimental/outdated versions of the webscraper. For the main python program, download the **"WalmartScraper.py** file and follow the instructions.
